Smart Attendance System
A simple Java GUI-based database project that helps manage student attendance and student records efficiently.
This standalone application connects to Microsoft SQL Server and allows faculty to view, add, and delete student information using a user-friendly interface built with Java Swing.

Features:
🧑‍🎓 Add New Student — Insert new student details (Roll No, Name, Gmail, Password).
📜 View All Students — Retrieve and display all student records from the database.
❌ Delete Student — Remove a student record by entering their Roll No.
💾 SQL Server Integration — Uses JDBC to connect Java with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Project Outcome:
Successfully designed and implemented a Java-based Smart Attendance Management System with a functional GUI.
Established a seamless database connection between Java and SQL Server using JDBC.
Enabled student data management — adding, viewing, and deleting records directly from the GUI.

Future Enhancements:
Add Faculty Login and Attendance Marking modules.
Include biometric or RFID integration.
Add export to Excel feature for attendance reports.
